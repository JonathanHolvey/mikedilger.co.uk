	<p><b>I am an experienced and relaxed presenter</b><br/>
	Having also spent a substantial time behind the camera, I fully appreciate the team ethic behind making TV and radio programmes and am always well prepared, willing to work incredibly hard, happy to muck in and in my own humble opinion, a joy to work with! My style is fun and informal.</p>
	<p><b>I can work anywhere</b><br/>
	Having spent long periods abroad in remote locations, I am tough, exceptionally experienced at logistics and can work, like the Martini advert, 'anytime, anyplace anywhere!'</p>
	<p><b>I speak fluent Spanish and basic Swahili and Vietnamese</b><br/>
	I have an innate ability to pick up languages quickly, and where gaps permit in my presenting schedule I use these in my work as a camera assistant. In 2007 I spent over two months working as a Director in Arctic Canada for the BBC Natural History Unit.</p>
	<p><b>I am a very experienced naturalist</b><br/>
	I have birded, botanized and entomologised in a huge range of countries and accumulated an encyclopaedic knowledge of British and South American wildlife and a strong familiarity with the nature of Vietnam, Tanzania and Arctic Canada.</p>
	<p><b>I am a member of many wildlife charities, including patron of:</b><br/></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Essex Badger Protection Group</li>
		<li>Disabled Birders Association</li>
		<li>Forest of Avon Trust</li>
		<li>Arnos Vale Cemetery Trust</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>I am trained as a PADI open water diver</b></p>
	<p><b>I am an experienced public speaker</b><br/>
	I have picked up an impressive array of diseases from my various travels in the Tropics, including malaria, bilharzia, leishmaniasis, septicaemia and ringworm, and have been nick-named Britain's most diseased man! Talks such as <i>My Diseases and other Animals</i>, <i>The Trials &amp; Tribulations of a Natural History Presenter</i> and other such presentations detailing my experiences working abroad and/or in television can be booked by interested groups.</p>
