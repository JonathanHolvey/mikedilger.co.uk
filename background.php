			<div class="subHeading">I consider myself an incredibly experienced and relaxed presenter</div>
			<p>Having spent a substantial time behind the camera, I fully appreciate the team ethic behind making TV and radio programmes and am always well prepared, willing to work incredibly hard and happy to muck in.</p>
			<p>Having spent long periods abroad in remote locations, I am pretty resilient, exceptionally experienced and happy to work, in the words of the  Martini advert, &quot;anytime, anyplace anywhere!&quot;</p>
			<div class="subHeading">I speak fluent Spanish and have a basic understanding of Swahili and Vietnamese</div>
			<p>On the rare occasions where gaps permit in my presenting schedule I also work as a director and camera assistant. In 2007, for example, I spent over two months working as a Director in Arctic Canada for the BBC Natural History Unit on the Natural World film <i>White Falcon, White Wolf</i>.</p>
			<div class="subHeading">I am an incredibly experienced naturalist</div>
			<p>I'm a passionate naturalist who has birded, botanized and entomologised in a huge range of countries, accumulating along the way an unparalleled expertise of British and South American wildlife. I also have a working knowledge of the nature of Vietnam, Tanzania and Arctic Canada.</p>
			<p>I have recently trained to the level of PADI Rescue Diver and <!-- expirable content --> will be undertaking my HSE part 4 Qualification in 2012 to open up the potential of carrying out more underwater work in front of the cameras.</p>
			<div class="subHeading">I have become an experienced public speaker</div>
			<p>I am a hugely accomplished and entertaining public speaker with experience of giving talks and lectures to both specialist groups and general audiences and am happy addressing anything from a small intimate audience to a packed theatre. In addition to a number of established talks I have recently acted as Master of Ceremonies at a number of events.</p>
			<p>Any of these talks (listed below) can be booked by interested groups or parties through my agent.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>My Diseases and Other Animals</i> is a hilarious and illuminating lecture inspired by my extensive travels in the Tropics. Having spent five year in the back-of-beyond I have picked up a weird and wonderful collection of diseases such as malaria, bilharzia and leishmaniasis;  leading to my nick-name of 'Britain's most diseased man'.</li>
				<li><i>The Trials and Tribulations of a Natural History Presenter</i> is an informative and entertaining lecture detailing everything you wanted to know about working as a wildlife presenter... but were afraid to ask.</li>
				<li><i>The Gyr Falcons of Ellesmere</i> is a whirlwind tour around the Canadian Arctic through the eyes of one the world's most charismatic birds of prey.</li>
				<li><i>Birds on the Beeb</i> is a trip down memory lane of some of my favourite birding moments over the last 10 years.</li>
				<li><i>Mike Dilger Shows You How to Fly</i> is a lesson in defying gravity!</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="heading">lesser known facts about me</div>
			<!--<p>I briefly held the Guinness World Record for &quot;The Most Snails on the Face in One Minute&quot;. At 37, the record was claimed in Covent Garden on the set of The One Show in 2009, before being beaten later that year.</p>
			<p>At the Rutland Birdfair I beat all other wildlife presenters to become Wild Brain of Britain 2010 and held onto the trophy at the Birdfair in 2011 – can I make it three years in a row!?</p>
			<p>Whilst confining my activity to weight-lifting, jogging and golf, I adore watching all sport. My support for Manchester United tends to be from the comfort of an armchair, I am however a sucker for punishment in the form of a Bristol City season ticket!</p>-->
			<p>Whilst best known for warbling about wildlife I'm also a huge sports fan. I particularly love football and my travels have enabled me to watch games everywhere from Bristol to Barcelona and Tanzania to Ecuador. Suffice to say <i>Match Of The Day</i> is essential viewing in the Dilger household!</p>
